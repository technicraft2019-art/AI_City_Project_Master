CityAI_Governance_MasterRules_v7
=========================================================================
Authoritative Governance Rules — City-AI Project
Supersedes v6. Establishes MDR as sole authority on variables.

0. File Hierarchy and Authorities
- Governance Master (this file): rules of operation.
- Intake Logs: SSOT for assets, components, functions, and systems at checkpoints.
- 50-Guide Outline (CityAI_Project_50_Guides_Outline.txt): curriculum order and teaching scope.
- SOPs / Workflow: operational procedures for producing and auditing guides.
- Master Declaration Registry (MDR): sole authority for variables; cumulative registry with Guide-of-Origin tagging.

1. Deliverable Format
- All guides must be delivered as FULL .txt files. No placeholders or truncation.
- All declarations added by a guide must be marked in MDR as [EXPANSION] and linked to Guide-of-Origin.

2. Guide Expansion Rules
- Each guide must follow the required Teacher Format sections:
  • Intro Narrative
  • Declarations Introduced (assets in Intake, variables in MDR)
  • Background Concepts
  • Step-by-Step Instructions
  • Verification Checklist
  • Common Mistakes and Fixes
  • Big Picture Connection

3. Teaching Depth Rules
- All guides are written for beginners in UE5.6.1 and Visual Studio 2022.
- Instructions must be step-by-step and explicit (no assumed knowledge).
- Retroactive expansion permitted if needed to clarify.

4. Chat-Specific Rules
- Unless otherwise requested, all outputs must be delivered as separate .txt downloads.
- Guide 1 must always establish the project name as CityAIProject.
- Chat continuity rules: Governance, Intake, Outline, SOP, and MDR must always be reloaded at the start of new chat sessions.

5. UE5.6.1 Standards Compliance
- Enhanced Input only; legacy input disallowed.
- Variables: prefix for bools, Category assigned, Instance Editable for tunables, explicit defaults.
- GameMode: neutral placeholder pawn unless explicitly overridden.
- Tags: class/actor tags applied at declaration and recorded in MDR.

6. Exhaustive Drafting Rule
- Each guide must declare immediate and foreseeable needs (1–2 guides ahead).
- No deferred declarations.

7. Alignment with the 50-Guide Outline
- Outline is SSOT for sequence and teaching scope.
- Audits must confirm alignment; drift requires rewrite or outline revision.

8. Intake Log Scope (updated)
- Intake is SSOT for assets, components, functions, and systems.
- Intake entries must list assets and systems, but delegate all variable details to MDR.
- Example:
  BP_VehicleBase (Pawn) [EXPANSION]
    • Variables: See MDR vN (Guide 1)

9. Master Declaration Registry (MDR Scope, updated)
- MDR is sole authority for variables.
- Each variable entry includes:
  • Name, type, defaults, metadata, tags.
  • Status: [BASE] or [EXPANSION].
  • Guide-of-Origin (Guide X).
- MDR is updated alongside Intake every 10 guides.
- MDR and Intake must remain synchronized: assets in Intake, variables in MDR.

10. Intake + Audit Requirements
- After every 10 guides:
  • Merge new assets/systems into Intake.
  • Merge new variables into MDR.
  • Produce an Audit Report that verifies:
    – UE5.6.1 compliance.
    – Outline alignment.
    – Intake vs MDR synchronization.
    – Guide-of-Origin tagging accuracy.

11. Enforcement
- Non-compliant guides are invalid and must be rewritten before continuing.
- Intake cannot list variables directly; all variable detail belongs in MDR.
- Audit must report pass/fail across compliance categories.
